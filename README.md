- **Interactive Charts**: View data in **bar** or **line** chart formats.
- **Date Filtering**: Filter data by a custom date range using a date picker.
- **Data Normalization**: Toggle between raw and normalized data.
- **Color Indicators**: Data values are color-coded (green or red) based on yearly averages.
